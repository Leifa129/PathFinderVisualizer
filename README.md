A project i started Wednesday 4th of March.  
This project is built on https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer  


The purpose of this project project is to showcase my ability with javascript/ES7 and path algorithms.  

I expect to finish this project by the end of the weekend: around Sunday 8th of March.  

What I need to do:  
- [x] Add automatic recomputation of the algorithm if start/end node is changed or if any walls are added. DONE
- [ ] Add more path searching algorithms.
- [ ] Tweak the randomized weighting to gain more varieties of best paths.
- [ ] Give option to generate a preset of walls.
- [ ] Make the application more user friendly.
- [ ] Possibly add explanations on how to use the program.
- [ ] Add more styling, find suitable icons for the start and end node.
- [ ] Refactor and cleanup.
- [x] Host the project on github.

The rest is autogenerated by react-create app.
------------------------------------
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
