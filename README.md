A project i started Wednesday 4th of March.  
This project is built on https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial


The purpose of this project project is to showcase my ability with javascript/ES7 and path algorithms.  

I expect to finish this project by the end of the weekend: around Sunday 8th of March.  

What I need to do:  
- [x] Add automatic recomputation of the algorithm if start/end node is changed or if any walls are added. DONE
- [x] Add more path searching algorithms.
- [x] Tweak the randomized weighting to gain more varieties of best paths.
- [ ] Give option to generate a preset of walls.
- [x] Make the application more user friendly.
- [ ] Possibly add explanations on how to use the program.
- [ ] Add more styling, maybe find suitable icons for the start and end node.
- [ ] Refactor and cleanup.
- [x] Host the project on github.
