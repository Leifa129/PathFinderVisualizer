A project i started Wednesday 4th of March.
This is the projected i built this from: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer


This project is to showcase my ability with javascript/ES7 and path algorithms.

I expect to finish the project by the end of the weekend Sunday 8th of March.

What I need to do:
Add automatic recomputation of the algorithm if start/end node is changed or if any walls are added.
Add more path searching algorithms.
Tweak the randomized weighting to gain more varieties of best paths.
Give option to generate a preset of walls.
Make the application more user friendly.
Possibly add explanations on how to use the program.
Add more styling, find suitable icons for the start and end node.
Refactor and cleanup.
Host the project on github.
